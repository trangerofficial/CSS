        <p id="main">Of all 6 steps in the song creation process, this is the most commonly skipped or rushed
            through.
            And yet in many ways it's the most fun and most helpful of them all as it has major implications
            on the remaining 4 steps. If you can get this step right your song has the most
            potential to be liked by the most people.
            What are we talking about? We're talking about the arrangement of your song. The flow,
            the layout of instrumentation. This also includes any and all production decisions as it relates
            to beats, loops, and virtual instruments.
            <p> </p>
            <p id="main">Let me ask you a question. If you were to hear your song on the radio, would you
                want to change the station after the first verse and chorus? Be honest.
                Most songs are super repetitive from a songwriting standpoint. And like I mentioned
                above, that's OK. What's NOT OK is a simple repetitive song that has a boring arrangement.
                One in which every verse sounds the same and every chorus sounds the same.
                Think about it - with most popular music, after you've heard the first verse and chorus
                (the hook) you pretty much know the entire song. So why keep listening?
                On most great songs, the arrangement is so interesting and always changing
                that you DO want to keep listening. How do they do it? By strategically introducing new
                and different elements to the song as it progresses.</p>
            <p id="main">Here are some common examples of elements YOU can introduce into YOUR songs to
                keep the arrangement/production interesting:
            </p> 
            <ul id="main">
                <li>● Vocal harmonies</li>
                <li>● Vocal effects (telephone vocal, distortion vocal, etc)</li>
                <li>● Percussion (shakers/tambourines)</li>
                <li>● Synths/strings/pads</li>
                <li>● Doubled (or tripled) vocals</li>
                <li>● Doubled guitar parts</li>
                <li>● Half-time feel or tempo changes</li>
            </ul>
